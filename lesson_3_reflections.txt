When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am not in my computer or somebody else want to do that commit.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That is because in most cases the project are big, and this will just
fill the remote and the local repository with information, rathar than
having a minimun information just needed
