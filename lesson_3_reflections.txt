When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am not in my computer or somebody else want to do that commit.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That is because in most cases the project are big, and this will just
fill the remote and the local repository with information, rathar than
having a minimun information just needed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Fork are part of GitHub, and are for cloning repositories of other people, that are open, on you own repository online. In this way the author of the repocitory gets credit as the origianl author.

clones are for doing somethig alike, but this time to copy a
repocitory on our computers, from the web.

Branches are a way of making a copy of an existing repocitories
to work independetly before merging it with the original, or master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?

Because you then can compared with the changes made
with the git fetch on the remote online with our
local master.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I guess the collaboration would be only comparing code,
maybe we can be better in spoting bugs or understanding
code, our own and of others. But this is definetly better
I dont really know how people can manage without a system
like this.
