What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I think that it is for creating the .git folder, where git is
going to work on.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It is a midpoint of a commit. Because we can commit multiple files,
it is better to think on what to commit after we have worked in more
files.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Because is very usefull for debugging and analysing files using the diff options. You can change and unchange the files without fearing that your
changes are going to be permanent.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

this is very usefull to make important changes to the code
or for creating something completely new with the exiting code,
and branches help to make this changes safe.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It shows how the different commits were conected, or the branchens
.It helps because we can see how we can move between the different
verstion or part of the project.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Mergint together two branches result in the addition of the new
lines a removal of the repeated ones on the code. It is very useful,
othewise we would have to do it manualy, and is illogical to make
a program a not automate this very act of making a program.





What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
